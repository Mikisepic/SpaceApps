		"Discussion": "Friday, mostly sunny skies across much of Louisiana will aid ozone formation. However, pollutant carryover will be low. Furthermore, in the southeastern corner of the state, clouds associated with Tropical Storm Nestor will hinder ozone development, and gusty winds will disperse pollutants. Therefore, AQI levels will be Good. Saturday, sunny skies combined with temperatures in the low- to mid-80s will enhance ozone formation statewide. Additionally, light winds will limit pollutant dispersion. Because of these conditions, AQI levels will be high-Good to low-Moderate. Sunday, light southerly winds during the morning hours will allow pollutant to accumulate, while fog will enhance particle formation. Furthermore, afternoon sunshine and temperatures in the mid- to upper-80s will aid ozone development. Thus, AQI levels will remain high-Good to low-Moderate."
